"""Require a `Bead: <id>` trailer on commit messages so git history and the
bd issue graph can be joined exactly. Ported from MysteryMixClub's
scripts/instrumentation/check_bead_trailer.py, adapted for tktk (single
main-branch model, no develop/staging -- see docs/git-hygiene.md).

Called from the commit-msg git hook (.husky/commit-msg), after commitlint
has already validated Conventional Commit formatting. This script only
checks the Bead trailer; it does not re-validate the commit type/format.

Bypass: commits whose Conventional Commit type is chore/docs/ci/style/build/
revert, or any merge commit, don't need a Bead trailer. Documented here and
in CLAUDE.md.

Exit 1 (blocks the commit) when a trailer is required and missing/invalid.
Exit 0 otherwise. This hook is allowed to block.

This script makes ZERO writes to the bd issue graph -- `bd show` (read-only)
is the only bd command it ever runs.
